![napkin-selection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de3a25ce-9141-4aa3-80a5-1e880fb14f6d)


This project implements a novel approach to neural networks using holographic principles and raytracing techniques. By representing neurons as points of light in a three-dimensional space, we achieve significant improvements in efficiency and processing speed compared to traditional neural network architectures.

## Features

- Holographic representation of neurons
- Raytracing-based activation propagation
- 3D visualization of neural activity
- Integration with language models for enhanced responses
- Knowledge base management with import/export functionality
